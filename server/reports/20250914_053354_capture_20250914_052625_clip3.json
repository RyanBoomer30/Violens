    "classification": "Simulated Self-Conflict",
    "detailed_report": "The video frames depict an individual alone in a classroom making gestures that involve mimicking self-punching motions. These gestures indicate a simulation of self-conflict or acting out aggression theatrically rather than engaging in real violence. The environment remains controlled with no others involved, suggesting this is likely a solo act of dramatization or stress-related behavior. To ensure safety and prevent potential escalation, it's recommended to engage the individual in dialogue to assess their emotional state and provide appropriate psychological support if needed. Additionally, creating a supportive environment may help in addressing any underlying issues."
