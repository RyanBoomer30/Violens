    "detailed_report": "The frames depict an individual alone in a room with a blackboard. The person is repeatedly making a motion of hitting themselves on the head with an open hand. This appears to be more of a frustrated or stressed gesture rather than a violent act directed towards others. Recommended actions include checking in on the individual's emotional well-being and offering support or counseling if needed, to help manage stress or frustration."
