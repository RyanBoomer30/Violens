    "detailed_report": "The video frames depict an individual in a classroom setting seemingly illustrating or expressing a point using gestures. There appear to be no signs of physical aggression or heated argument. The arm movements towards the end suggest emphasis rather than violence. It's advisable to ensure the individual's gestures remain non-threatening and to maintain a calm and focused environment for continued safety. No immediate action for de-escalation is necessary as no aggressive behavior is evident."
