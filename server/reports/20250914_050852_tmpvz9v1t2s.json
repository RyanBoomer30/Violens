    "detailed_report": "The video frames show an individual sitting and appearing to engage in a non-violent, personal activity. The movements seen in the frames such as hand gestures do not indicate any aggression or violence. There are no signs of conflict, such as another person present or confrontational postures. It seems the individual might be expressing frustration, potentially related to the activity undertaken, but does not present a safety risk. No immediate intervention is necessary other than ensuring a supportive environment. Encourage the individual to take a break if frustration is evident."
