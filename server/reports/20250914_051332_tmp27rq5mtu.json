    "detailed_report": "The frames depict an individual sitting in a classroom setting, appearing to be focused and engaged with a task. The movements observed, such as hand gestures or facial expressions, do not suggest any signs of violence, aggression, or fighting. The person seems to be demonstrating understanding or emphasis rather than any hostile behavior. Recommended actions include maintaining a calm environment and encouraging peaceful communication. No de-escalation measures are necessary as there is no conflict present in the observed frames."
